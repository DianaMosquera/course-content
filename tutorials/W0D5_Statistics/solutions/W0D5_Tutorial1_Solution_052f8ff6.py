""" The limits of the histogram at 0 and 10, as these are the minimum and maximum
number of trials that a rat can turn left out of 10 trials. The shape seems
symmetric and is centered around 5. Since an average/mean around 5 left turns out
of 10 trials implies 5 right turns by the rat on average as well, it is very likely
the rat chose left and right turns in the maze with equal probability.
