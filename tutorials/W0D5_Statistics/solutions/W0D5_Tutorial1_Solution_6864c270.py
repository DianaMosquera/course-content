""" Have you noticed that the distribution starts to look more symmetric with
more samples? This is a result of the Central Limit Theorem, where a large number
of sampled values makes samples from the Poisson distribution look similarly
distributed to the symmetric Gaussian (Normal) distribution.

Increasing lambda also makes the spread of samples from a poisson distribution more
symmetric and able to be approximated by the normal distribution. This approximation
gets better and better with larger sample sizes, and larger values of lambda.
